                    I am a computer science major at Cal Poly Pomona. I am just trying to make it through and get my degree.<br>
                    Currently my third year attending Cal Poly.

            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>I played a lot of competative games, but mostly played <i>League of Legends</i> purely for ranked and competing with friends.<br>
                However, most of my friends have stopped playing to rank up and naturally I did as well. I ended up with the rank of <b>Masters</b>.<br>
                My secret shame.<br>
                I have tried other games, but I do not really play them anymore just waiting for Riot's MMO to come out.
